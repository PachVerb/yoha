## IEngine.DownloadModel() method

Fetches the model files and reports download progress.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
DownloadModel(progressCb?: IDownloadProgressCb): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  progressCb | [IDownloadProgressCb](./yoha.idownloadprogresscb.md) | See [IDownloadProgressCb](./yoha.idownloadprogresscb.md)<!-- -->. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

A promise that resolves once the download is complete.

## Remarks

- This function can be optionally called before [IEngine.Start()](./yoha.iengine.start.md) and [IEngine.Warmup()](./yoha.iengine.warmup.md) to fetch the model data while also being able to observe download progress. If omitted, the first call to either [IEngine.Start()](./yoha.iengine.start.md) or [IEngine.Warmup()](./yoha.iengine.warmup.md) will download the model data which does not provide the ability to observe the download progress.

- The engine relies on a machine learning model to perform the hand tracking. This model consists of learned parameters that have to be fetched before the hand tracking can start.
