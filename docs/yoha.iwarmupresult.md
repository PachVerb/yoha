## IWarmupResult interface

The result of a call to [IEngine.Warmup()](./yoha.iengine.warmup.md)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface IWarmupResult 
```

## Remarks

Please note that the returned performance estimates are based on small samples (to keep the warmup phase as short as possible) and may be inaccurate. For implementing thresholding based on these estimates (e.g. if FPS is below X, disable handtracking) it is recommended to either incorporate decent slack into the threshold or to actually start the engine and collect accurate performance estimates using larger samples.

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [avgFpsEstimate](./yoha.iwarmupresult.avgfpsestimate.md) | number | Estimate for the average FPS that the engine can process. |
|  [maxFpsEstimate](./yoha.iwarmupresult.maxfpsestimate.md) | number | Estimate for the maximum possible FPS that the engine can process. |
